# Customer Segmentation with KMeans

This project uses KMeans clustering and PCA to segment customers based on age, income, and spending score.

## 🧠 Objective

Identify groups of customers with similar behaviors to improve product targeting, marketing efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

---

## 📊 Features Used

- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

---

## 📈 Results

Three clusters were identified:
- Cluster 0: Mid-age, mid-income, high spenders
- Cluster 1: Older, high-income, high spenders
- Cluster 2: Younger, low-income, low spenders

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- **Cluster 1 (high-income, high-spend)**: Promote premium or exclusive offerings and loyalty rewards.
- **Cluster 2 (low-income, low-spend)**: Offer discounts or bundle deals to increase purchase value.
